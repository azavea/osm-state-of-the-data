# OSM State of the Data

This application contains a series of tools for viewing and monitoring OSM edit recency.

A React app (`./app-frontend`) displays vector tiles of gridded edit recency and allows
users to create and manage notifications for areas of interest (AOI) where they'd like to
be notified of new changes.

An HTTP API that implements the backend for handling state management of AOI monitoring notifications.
